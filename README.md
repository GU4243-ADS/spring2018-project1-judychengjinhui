### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Spring 2018

+ Project title: spooky suspense--a text analysis of how SPOOKY authors create horror through suspense

+ This project is conducted by Judy Cheng

+ Project summary: 

In this assignment, I analyze how each author creates suspense through certain words and punctuation. 

To identify suspenseful words, I use the NRC sentiment lexicon and filter out words that fall into the categories most closely related to suspense: anticipation, surprise, and fear.

In the punctuation part, I focus on the suspenseful effects of commas, semicolons, ellipses, and question marks. While analyzing suspense, I also 1)compared how much the machine-learned text analysis confirms the human-generated remarks on the authors' respective literary themes and 2)uncovered each author's typical sentence structure. 

To spark reader interest, I will not disclose the findings of my analysis here in the summary, but there will be a summary of my findings a the end of the r notebook rmd/html file.
